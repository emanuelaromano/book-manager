### Run locally (root workflow)

Tested with:
- Node.js v22
- npm 11.6.1
- Docker (for Postgres)

#### Quick Setup (Recommended)

Make the setup script executable and run it:

chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh

This will install dependencies, create environment variables, start the database, and provide instructions for running the app.

```bash
npm run deps
```

_Create default env variables_
```bash
npm run envs -- -default
```

_Start Postgres via Docker_
```bash
npm run db:up
```

_Run backend and frontend together (two processes)_

```

_Stop and remove containers when done_
```bash
npm run db:down
```
